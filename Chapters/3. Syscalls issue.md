Add `` flag to linker:
```patch
-- LDFLAGS=
++ LDFLAGS= -specs=nosys.specs
```

- `-specs=nosys.specs` - The `-specs=` option in GCC is used to specify alternative specs files. Specs files are special scripts used by GCC to control the build process, including default options, linker scripts, and libraries to be used during compilation and linking.
  
  The `nosys.specs` option is used when building applications for systems without a traditional operating system (hence "no system" or "nosys"). It provides stubs for system calls that are typically provided by an OS, such as file operations, process control, or time functions. When linking with nosys.specs, calls to these functions will return errors or do nothing, allowing your application to link and run in environments without OS support.

## Time to compile

Now try to build project (**Remember to clean first!**):
```powershell
PS E:\Projects\STM32\stm32f767 clean project> make clean; make
rm -f *.o *.elf *.bin

## Conclusion
Project compiled with warnings.

These warnings are usually harmless in the context of an embedded system where we don't expect filesystem or standard I/O operations to work like they would on a desktop or server operating system. They're more about informing you of the limitations than indicating something is wrong with your project.

AFAIK those warnings comes from newest version of ARM toolchain - previously warning wasn't showed.

We will provide our stub implementation of thos functions to supress warnings.
