Let's clean up the file structure a bit.

## `.gitignore` file
It's common practice to use git in projects. This project also uses it so we need to tell him, that we don't want to push binaries created during compilation to repository:
- create `.gitignore` file in the root of project and add some wildards with file extensions there:
    ```.gitignore
    *.bin
    *.elf
    *.map
    *.o
    ```
- This tutorial will not explain how git works, but only shows actions that you should perform during new project creation.

## Move sources to `/src` folder
I suggest to create `/src` folder and place all the sources there.
It will allow us to create unit test's folder which will be not a part of the project release binaries.

Move following files into created folder:
- `main.c`
- `syscalls.c`
- `startup_stm32f767xx.s`
- `Makefile`

Now we are able to run `make` command inside `src/` folder. Let's create simple `Makefile` in the project root directory and call targets from the `src/` folder:

```Makefile
all:
	make -C src

clean:
	make -C src clean
```
