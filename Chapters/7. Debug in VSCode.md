To run debug session in Visual Studio Code under Windows we will need to install some third party software:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Open OCD for Windows](https://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd)
- [Cortex-Debug extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug)
- [SVD file for our Microcontroller (STM32F767)](https://github.com/amosnier/ecg/blob/master/svd/STM32F7/STM32F767.svd) - attached to repository
## Preparing VSCode

### `.vscode` folder
Create folder `.vscode` if it isn't exist.
This folder contains our VSCode IDE project specific settings.

### `.vscode/tasks.json`
We need to configure build tasks.
It is needed to allow to automatically build our project before launch debug session.

It will allow to use "build" shortcut (usually `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`B`).

Create file named `tasks.json` inside `.vscode` folder and paste the following lines into it:
```json
{
	"version": "2.0.0",
	"tasks": [
		{
			"label": "Build STM",
			"type": "shell",
			"command": "make",
			"options": {
				"cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
			},
			"group": {
				"kind": "build",
				"isDefault": true
			},
			"problemMatcher": [
				"$gcc"
			]
		},
		{
			"label": "Rebuild STM",
			"dependsOrder": "sequence",
			"dependsOn": [
				"Clean STM", "Build STM"
			],
			"group": {
				"kind": "build"
			}
		},
		{
			"label": "Clean STM",
			"type": "shell",
			"command": "make clean",
			"options": {
				"cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
			},
			"group": {
				"kind": "build"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

We will not discuss `json` format here, but there are some options that should be explained:
- `type` - Type of task. In our cas this is `shell` which means that our task will be running in shell (bash, cmd or powershell)
- `command` - Command to execute in shell. We will use our `Makefile` with `make` command
- `options` - there are some default values which can be overwritten:
  - `cwd` - defines working directory for running command
    - `${workspaceRoot}` is VSCode variable - it will be replaced by path to workspace root folder.
  - `env` - we can provide some environment variables
  - `shell` - we can define type of shell that will be used
- `group` - defines task's group options:
  - `kind` - Defines task group:
    - `build` - It will be possible to run it from `Run Build Task...` menu option
  - `isDefault` - `true` value marks task as default. It will be run without prompt when user enters "build" shortcut.
- `dependsOn` - defines list of task that need to be executed before running this specific task
- `dependsOrder` - changes order of running task specified in dependency list:
  - `parallel` - run all task in same time
  - `sequence` - run tasks in order
- `problemMatcher` - defines how VSCode should understand output from compilation console. If there will be compilation warnings / errors - it will read them, put in `PROBLEMS` tab and highliht in project sources.

You can read more about variables such as `${workspaceRoot}` here [VSCode - Variables Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference)

### `.vscode/launch.json`
To launch debug session in VSCode we have to configure it.

To make this we have to create `tasks.json` file inside `.vscode` folder:
```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug STM32",
            "type": "cortex-debug",
            "request": "launch",
            "servertype": "openocd",
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "executable": "./main.elf",
            "configFiles": [
                "openocd.cfg"
            ],
            "svdFile": "${workspaceRoot}/STM32F767.svd",
            "preLaunchTask": "Build STM"
        }
    ]
}
```

About configured options:
- `type` - defines which extension we will use for debugging. `cortex-debug` means that we will use `Cortex-Debug` extension
- `request` - we can use one of two options:
  - `attach` - it allow us to connect to running program
  - `launch` - it will run the program from the beginning
- `servertype` - defines how we will connect to our board. We will use `openocd` option. You can try other, like `stlink`
- `cwd` - defines path where debugger will look for executable and source code
- `executable` - defines path to binary file to upload
- `configFiles` - openOCD configuration file
- `svdFile` - path to SVD file for specific family of Microcontroller. It contains definitions of microcontrollers peripherals. It is not necessary, but recommended.
- `preLaunchTask` - defines name of task which will be run before launch debug session. We will run `Build STM` task.

### `.vscode/settings.json`
This file contains settings specific for installed extensions.

If you don't want to add path to ARM toolchain or OpenOCD to system `Path` environment variable or you want to use specific version, you can provide your custom value.

To do this, you need to create `.settings` file (or append configuration variables to existing one):
```json
{
    "cortex-debug.armToolchainPath": "C:\\ST\\STM32CubeCLT\\GNU-tools-for-STM32\\bin",
    "cortex-debug.openocdPath": "C:\\Programy\\openocd\\bin\\openocd.exe"
}
```

### `openocd.cfg`
This file contains OpenOCD configuration.

Here is the content of the file:
```
source [find interface/stlink.cfg]
source [find target/stm32f7x.cfg]
```

`source` command includes content of specified file (script). You can find support files in `{openocd_path}/share/openocd/scripts` path

If we want to specify programmer serial number (for example to launch more than one debug session at once), we can specify `adapter serial` option:
```
adapter serial "0669FF383834434257194428"
```

There are many ways to find serial number of your adapter, for example:
- use STM32CubeProgrammer:

![](assets/stm32%20cube%20programmer.png)
- use Windows device manager:

![](assets/device%20manager%20stlink%20serial.png)

Probably you don't want to commit your programmer's serial number to repository, so you can pass `adapter serial` as argument to openocd launch command. To do this you have to insert parameter into `.vscode/launch.json` file:
```json
	"serverArgs": ["-c", "adapter serial 0669FF383834434257194428"],
```
Now you are able to create separated launch task for different boards.

## Launch
Add a breakpoint inside `main()` function and run debug.
Now you can debug your ARM board in VSCode with full knowledge about how it works underneath!
