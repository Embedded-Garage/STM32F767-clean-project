We will prepare our project to be able to Unit Test it.

## Submodules 
The git tool allows you to use "submodules" - linking external repositories inside a subfolder in the repository you are creating. The tool is useful, but it introduces additional dependencies on external libraries, and we also need to be sure that the connected repository will not be moved/deleted. Using this tool can also be cumbersome for inexperienced `git` users.

In this tutorial we will not use a submodule, instead we will simply download the source directory of an external library and place it in our repository.

## Download sources of ThrowTheSwitch Unity - unit testing framework
- On the [ThrowTheSwitch Unity Framework](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity/tree/master) repository website download code as `.zip` file.
- Extract compressed file
- create `unit_test/` folder in the project's root directory
- create `unity/` folder inside previously created folder (`unit_test/unity`)
- copy files `unity_internals.h`, `unity.c`, `unity.h` from downloaded archive to `unit_test/unity` (you can find them in `src` folder)
